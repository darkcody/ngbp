# heimdall

Heimdall is the sentry of Asgard and a member of the Aesir (the gods of the
Norse pantheon). His most important function within Norse mythology is to herald
the coming of the apocalypse (Ragnarök) by sounding his majestic trumpet
(Gjallarhorn) and leading the Aesir into their final battle. Heimdall is known
for his hyper-acute senses (particularly his hearing) and for his antipathy
towards Loki, who he will die fighting during the battle of Ragnarök.
